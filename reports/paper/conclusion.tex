\section{Conclusion}

\indent{\indent In this paper, we applied the feature-based method in the image classification task. The constructed algorithm is implemented and evaluated on the real plant dataset containing images of 12 different types of seedlings. We selected and extracted features using computer vision algorithms. As it is shown in Table \ref{table:metrics_all}, the best performance is reached with Support Vector Machines algorithm. The detailed result for the best method is shown in Table \ref{table:metrics}. Some of the classes are not recognized well due to minor differences between some types of proposed plants. The future work is aimed to improve segmentation output and to try other types of image features.}
