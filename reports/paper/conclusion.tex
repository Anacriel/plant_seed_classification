\section{Conclusion}

\indent{\indent In this paper, we apply the feature-based method in the image classification task. The constructed algorithm is implemented and evaluated on the real plant dataset containing images of 12 different types of seedlings. We select and extract features using computer vision algorithms. As it is shown in Table \ref{table:metrics_all}, the best performance is reached with the Support Vector Machines algorithm. The detailed result for the best method is shown in Table \ref{table:metrics}. Some of the classes are not recognized well because of the minor differences between some types of proposed plants. The future work aims at improving segmentation output and at the usage of other types of image features.}
