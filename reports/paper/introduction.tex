\section{Introduction}
\indent{\indent The need for agricultural products is increasing every day, as the population of planet Earth is growing. Part of the work is done by people, and the forces go to quality control of crops grown. We will be able to use temporary and natural resources more carefully and economically, increase yields if we learn to differentiate noble crops and distinguish them from weeds without human help. }

\indent{ In such a situation, the idea of automation of processes naturally arises, for example, the classification of seedlings by photographs. There is an idea to use neural networks, which is justified by the advantages, but they also have disadvantages in the form of computational costs. It is possible to use less costly algorithms, but they require finer tuning to achieve a comparable result.}
